# Assignment 1
This assignment consists of two exercises: A) A classification problem, and B) a Regression task using tree methods.

In order to complete this assignment, both tasks need to be completed. The assignment will be counted as complete if all relevant steps in the task are carried out and the questions in the end are answered. Code needs to be executable without errors using the DSA 104 environment.

The assignments are to be submitted to johannes.schoergenhumer@chem.uzh.ch before the next Wednesday session starts (i.e. 13:00), when the solution of the assignments will be discussed. No individual feedback will be given other than if the assignment was found to be complete.
